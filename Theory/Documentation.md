Documentation:
I forgot to do the documentation for most of the development process, but I will put down what I remember.  
First, I started with the Identifying and defining, which I was able to do in a few weeks. After that I moved onto the researching and planning phase, however this was somewhat interrupted by my absences and the prelim exam block in week 9, so I was only able to complete about half of it. I did all of this on seperate files to be imported to this one later, as I didn't realise there was a need for gradual commit progress. I uploaded the google form for primary research in the middle of the week before the task was due. After that, I did almost all the practical coding, as well as the evaluation and anything else I could get to do in time, on the last weekend before it was due as I was behind and that's also why there isn't many commits to the github.
