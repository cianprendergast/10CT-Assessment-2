    <p>As this is the first spotlight I have chosen one of my own favourite artists and I think he does fit the 'small' criteria.<br>
        DM DOKURO is a solo music producer from the USA, who primarily focuses 
        on metal, rock, and electronic music.<br>
        He is primarily known for his early undertale remixes as well as his slightly more recent work on the Calamity mod for the game Terraria.<br><br>
        Below is a song I think showcases his style pretty well and comes from his newest album 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuMmQJLjyMo&t=3589s">they know who they are | act 1: downfall</a><br> (warning its a bit loud and you should change the files volume to 20% or less)</p><br>
