Peer Evaluation:  
The website was able to display an artist but no more than one due to time constriction, however it still showed information on them and had a song that you could try listening to, to see if you like their music. I found that it would help me to find possible new artists that I could enjoy as it seemed really intuitive to understand and there wasn't much you had to do, apart from listen to a song and see if you like it. It contained not only the artists spotify and youtube, but also their bandcamp. The main page only had a link to the showcased artist page rather than displaying the artist who is being displayed, and I started on the filter but found it wasn't worth working on in comparison to other things, considering there was only one artist on the page for now. I was able to select a song to play on the artists page and it worked fine. The description of how you would navigate the website in the functional requirements was very accurate. The text was easy to read and consistent in size and placement throughout the website, making it easily navigable. I didn't get the chance to test across different devices due to time constraints, but it worked fine on my device on 2 different browsers - Opera GX and Google Chrome.  
Issue Evaluation:  
There wasn't really any social issues with my product, as there isn't a social aspect of it to begin with. The ethical responsibilities with this product are that there is some way for the artists to reach out in case they want the music to be taken down, or they want to change their entry in any way, which there isn't really any way to do right now, but it would be a simple fix of making an email or other easy to create service that allows communication account and adding that to the contact section of the website, which is currently a blank page. The legal issues with the product are that the artists may not be ok with their music being used on a site without their permission, and there isn't really a good fix for that, apart from reaching out to the artists beforehand, which isn't always straightforward in any capacity and would hinder the amount of artists that could be shown.  
Project Evaluation:  
Overall, the project met most of the functional and non functional requirements, though there were certain aspects, such as looks that could've been improved. My management of the project was lackluster at best and even though part of the time issue was just due to missing lessons, I definitely could've and should've taken more time earlier to work on the project and catch up. Even still, the website turned out pretty good and though some of the theory work may not be done, there's still a good amount of lessons on time management that I have taken away from this project, such as doing catch up work sooner rather than later, and actually taking time to do it outside of alotted class time. I found that those who I could show it to found it interesting and that it definitely made it easier and more accessible to find smaller artists as all they had to do was go through to the showcased artist and listen to their song. They were slightly disappointed when they realised I hadn't finished the genre search page yet, as they wanted to be able to find music of their favourite genre.
