        <h3>This is my website where I showcase various small music artists in the hopes of giving them more recognition</h3>
        <p>This is where I would put more info on the motives and whatnot but it's really just for a school project. 
        <br>Extra line of text to make it seem like there's more than there actually is.
        <br>Under here you will find the links to the genre selection and the current spotlighted Artist
        <br><h1><a href="spotlight.html">Current Spotlighted Artist</a>
